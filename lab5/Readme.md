Lab 5:
This lab we will be experimenting with multiple inputs and outputs.  There will be two parts:

1) You will be using 4 LEDS and a photoresistor.  Put all 4 LEDs next to each (preferably the same color).  As the amount of light seen by the photoresistor decreases, increase the number of LEDs that are lit.  For example, if your circuit receives no light then all of the LEDs should light up.  As you continue to increase the amount of light, the number of LEDs that light up will decrease.  So when the photoresistor receives the half the amount of light, 2 LEDS should be lit up, and when there is no light, all 4 LEDs should be lit up.

2) In parallel with part 1, you will be using the the passive buzzer and the potentiometer.  Use the potentiometer as an analog input and have the output come from another analog pin.  Control the volume of the buzzer by adjusting the potentiometer.  Make sure to have code to control the output of the buzzer based on the potentiometer.

OPTIONAL: you can add a button to turn on and off the buzzer

If you have to older kits and don't have a buzzer, user a servo motor and control it with your potentiometer (this should rotate and change positions based on your potentiometer).
