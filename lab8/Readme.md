work with a partner, or if you have two arduino devices you can work alone
connect two arduino's via a hardwired serial connection (no usb cable) (digital pins 0 and 1)
connect a button and an external LED to each device
pressing the button on one arduino should cause the other arduino's LED to change state (on to off, or off to on)
Button press on one arduino should toggle the state of the LED on the other (on/off) and not keep the LED lit while being pressed
utilize the 16x2 display for debugging
refer to lab 6 for all the info about serial communication and lab2 for maintaining led states with button presses .
 
Hints:
Both boards have to share the same ground in order for the serial communication to work properly
 
The same code should run on both arduinos. You and your partner may submit the same code, if you both have worked on it together.
Your circuit needs to be checked out, and the code submitted to blackboard, before 5pm on 11/4
