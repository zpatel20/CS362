We want to start incorporating more complicated devices into our circuits. 
For lab 4 your design will incorporate the light sensitive resistor photocell
and display relevant information about the photocell value onto the 16x2 display.
Prelab:
Get your photoresistor wired correctly and have the "value" read from the photoresistor output to the serial monitor of the arduino software. 
As shown here http://playground.arduino.cc/Learning/PhotoResistor
 
More information about photoresistors and their operation can be found at:

Lab:
Create a circuit and sketch that will use a photoresistor and the 16x2 display. The display should state the relative amount of light in the room (dark, partially dark, medium, partially light, fully lit.) in the room, or fully lit, or somewhere in between should be displayed based on the value read from the photocell. This involves you determining the range of values the photoresistor provides and then making reasonable ranges for the values being considered.
