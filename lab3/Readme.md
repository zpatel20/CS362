Learning Goals:

Learn how to use more complicated forms of output.
Get practice setting up circuits using a schematic.
Prelab:

Follow this tutorial to get your LCD screen scrolling hello world: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/LiquidCrystalScroll

Note that the written instructions on hooking up your LCD screen are incomplete - make sure to follow the schematic!  The potentiometer will control the screen brightness.


Lab:
Display your name and your favorite quote appear on the 16x2 display, name on first line and quote on the second line. The quote should not all fit on the screen and so should scroll across the screen. Your name should not scroll across the screen, only the quote should scroll.  Hint: I recommend writing your own scrolling, rather than using the library methods.

Your circuit needs to be checked out, and the code submitted to blackboard, before 5pm on 9/30.
