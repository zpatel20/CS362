Prelab:
complete the tutorial on graphing analog input located at http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Graph
Another tutorial showing the basics of using the Arduino and Processing together 
https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/connecting-arduino-to-processing#introduction
 
Software :
Download processing from here https://www.processing.org/download/?processing
 
Lab: 
Connect two analog devices to the arduino and plot the data received on the computer using processing.
Data could be displayed in two separate graphs  or both on one graph .
 
Some analog devices that you might already have include:
potentiometer
thermistor 
photo resistor
force sensitive resistor
 
Lab needs to be checked out, and the code (both arduino code and processing code) submitted to blackboard, before 5pm on 11/11
Note : Processing might not be installed on lab computers . So you might need to bring your personal laptops to get the lab verified .
